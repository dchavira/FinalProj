                a password. Once satisfied, click on the button "Create". You created an account! You will
                be directed to the main feed. Note that a profile picture will be chosen for you at random.

                If you ever need to get back to this page on the login page, the question mark (?) in the upper-right
                will take you back here.

            <h2>How to Use the Navigation Panel</h2>
            <p>Once you are logged in, the navigation panel on the left of the screen with your profile picture 
                can take you to your profile, which will list all your posts; edit your profile, such as changing 
                your username or password; or simply logout. Logging out will take you back to the login page.

            <img src="../images/nav-panel.jpg" alt="Navigation panel with profile picture and buttons to profile, edit, and logout">
            <p>The box to the left over the user posts displays when you click on Edit Profile in the navigation panel.</p>

            <h2>Seeing Posts from Yourself and Other Users</h2>
            <p>Next to the navigation panel is the feed view where there is a list of posts from other users.
                The posts will have the option to view the user's profile, which would list their posts, or expand
                the post as seen in the picture.

            <h2>Using the Search Bar and the Results</h2>
            <p>You can search for songs, albums, artists, and users with the search feature. Simply use the
                dropdown menu to choose which you would like to search for, then type the name of
                the artist, album, or song you are looking for.

            <p>If search results are found, the posts about your search will be listed as the picture
                above--very similar to how your home feed looks. Otherwise, a statement saying, "No 
                results found" will be displayed. To go back to the main feed, simply click on the
                website's title MusicBook.

            <h2>How to Create a Post</h2>
            <p>To create a new post of your own, the create a new post icon is located on the bottom-right of 
                the page, which is a plus sign in a circle. This will prompt textboxes for you to fill in order
                to create your own post. If you decide you do not want to create a post you can click on the x
                in the black circle on the upper-right of the new post box.
